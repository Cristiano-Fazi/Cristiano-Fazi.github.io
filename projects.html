                    This web application allows users to create accounts and send messages to fellow users. The site uses cookies, both front and back end, to
                    maintain user sessions and log them out after a considerable period of inactivity. The front-end of the website is made entirely in react, while
                    the back-end uses javascript. The database used to store the messages and users was mongoDb. Creating this website greatly increased my understanding
                    of user to user communication as well as allowing to familiarize myself with the highly popular react framework.

                    Fitfolio is an android application created using kotlin, Jetpack compose and firebase. The purpose of the app is to allow users to plan workouts, keep
                    track of their workouts and generally make life easier for people going to the gym. Users are required to log in in order to access the applications 
                    services. Once they've logged in, users can create, delete and update their workout routines as well as follow a routine while exercising. Creating This
                    app allowed me to learn a lot about android and mobile development in general, an essential skill for an software developer.

                    My github pages currently serves as my online presence and because of this I have been diligent in crafting the best experience I can given the limited
                    capabilities of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Unfortunately, github pages does not allow developers to use frameworks like react to craft more professional\
                    looking user experiences. However, this limitation has forced me to improve my understanding of these more basic concepts significantly, which will udoublty 
                    help me create better user experiences using the more advanced frameworks.

                    This desktop application simulates a vending machine virtually. The application allows users to buy items from the vending machine either by cash or 
                    by card, not using real tender of course. The application will remember  how much of each item has been bought using it's database. While the application 
                    is not practical whatsoever, it allowed me to greatly develop my understanding of front-end user experience development. I am happy with the visuals and
                    believe that this application is displays some of my best work, with regards to user experience and presentation.

                    This farming game, written entirely in javascript, is in it's very early stages of development and therefore many of it's key features have yet to be implemented
                    of fleshed out. As it stand now, the game is essentially unplayable. However, I do have great plans for this game, I play to add many features that one would expect
                    from a game like this; crops growing over time, tilling the soil, and destruction of objects being just a few things planned.
